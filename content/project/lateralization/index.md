Many post-stroke aphasia studies select participants according to two criteria: they must have a left-hemisphere stroke, and the must present with language deficits. These selection criteria create a feedback loop where all the studies focus on individuals with left hemisphere damage and language deficits, without examining patients with left hemisphere damage but _without_ language deficits or patients with _right hemisphere_ damage who still have language deficits.

By examing a large, unselected sample, we can get a clearer picture of how language is lateralized, free from the selection bias of traditional aphasia studies.
