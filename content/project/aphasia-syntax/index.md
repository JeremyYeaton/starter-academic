Language impairments, broadly known as _aphasia_ are a common result of left hemisphere stroke. Aphasia looks different for every patient, but there are patterns across individuals between what area is damaged and what parts of the language system are impaired. By comparing the language abilities and brain scans of a large cohort of adults with aphasia, we can extract patterns to help us better understand the composition of the language system, as well as which parts of the brain underlie the components of the system.
