An outstanding question in both psycho- and neurolinguistics is whether the same computational and neurobiological architecture is used to both generate and comprehend the hierarchical structure of sentences. Using a novel task which touches on receptive metalinguistic judgments, sentence repetition, and sentence production, we can create a clear picture of syntactic abilities in input and output for healthy as well as brain-damaged patients. By comparing performance across the different levels of the task, we hope to see dissociations which might provide insight into the architecture of the syntactic system(s).
