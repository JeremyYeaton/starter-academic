Most studies of reading use experiments that employ contrived sentences designed to see how people react to bizarre input and/or use the Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) paradigm which presents one word at a time at the same location. While these can be informative, neither addresses how people _actually_ read under normal circumstances. The main goal of this project is to produce a co-registered eye-tracking and EEG dataset of people reading a real text (in this case, several chapters of a novel), under naturalistic conditions. While this can help answer some of our own research questions, it can also serve as a resource to others who want to test out their own predictions about language processing in a natural setting without having to design an experiment and collect their own data.
