Many languages exhibit Negative Concord, that is when two negative items are interpreted as a single negation. For example, if a man has robbed a bank and says _I didn't do nothing_, we understand this as _I didn't do anything_ even though he used two negative words--_didn't_ and _nothing_. By contrast, if a mother comes home from work and finds her child sitting in front of the television, she might accuse them of having done nothing all day, to which they might reply _I didn't do nothing_. The child, however means exactly the opposite of what the bank robber meant -- that they _did_ do _something_. French speakers have been shown to easily access both of these readings (Déprez et al. 2015), so we've undertaken a series of experiments to see how context (Déprez & Yeaton 2018), and prosody (Yeaton et al. forthcoming) might be employed to convey meaning. We also want to examine how good listeners are at leveraging these prosodic signals to access the meaning that the speaker intended (Loder et al. forthcoming).
