I'm a PhD student in Language Science at the University of California, Irvine. I'm generally interested in how language--particularly syntax--is stored, structured, and processed in the brain. My main question is whether sentence production and comprehension rely on identical, distinct, or partially shared neural systems. I use a mixed-methods approach which involves a combination of quantitative, qualitative, computational, and neuroimaging methods.
I am advised by Greg Hickok at UC Irvine, and William Matchin at the University of South Carolina.

**I am looking for postdoc positions in the cognitive neurobiology of language to start fall 2025. If you think that I would be a good fit for your lab, please send me an email!**

<!-- At the moment, they're looking at the lemma level (i.e.: the representation of words in the brain before you put sounds to them). They also have collaborators around the world looking at anything from theoretical syntax to baboon memory. -->

<!-- After growing up in New Jersey, they double majored in Linguistics & French, and minored in Chinese at Rutgers University - New Brunswick. After graduating, they worked for a year at the US Department of State’s School of Language Studies outside Washington, DC, spent a year in Haskovo (Хасково), Bulgaria teaching English to high schoolers on a Fulbright grant, and then moved to Paris to complete a master’s degree in Cognitive Science at the École Normale Supérieure. After finishing their master’s, they moved to Marseille, France where they worked as the Biological Signal Processing and Data Analysis Engineer for Jonathan Grainger’s ERC Advanced Grant within the Cognitive Psychology Lab at Aix-Marseille University. In that role, they analyzed EEG and eye-tracking data from experiments that pertain to orthographic, lexical, and sentence-level processing in reading. They also undertook a series of experiments examining sequence learning in baboons. -->
