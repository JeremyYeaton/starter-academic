abstract: Acquiring a new language requires individuals to simultaneously and gradually
  learn linguistic attributes on multiple levels. Here, we investigated how this learning
  process changes the neural encoding of natural speech by assessing the encoding
  of the linguistic feature hierarchy in second-language listeners. Electroencephalography
  (EEG) signals were recorded from native Mandarin speakers with varied English proficiency
  and from native English speakers while they listened to audio-stories in English.
  We measured the temporal response functions (TRFs) for acoustic, phonemic, phonotactic,
  and semantic features in individual participants and found a main effect of proficiency
  on linguistic encoding. This effect of second-language proficiency was particularly
  prominent on the neural encoding of phonemes, showing stronger encoding of “new”
  phonemic contrasts (i.e., English contrasts that do not exist in Mandarin) with
  increasing proficiency. Overall, we found that the nonnative listeners with higher
  proficiency levels had a linguistic feature representation more similar to that
  of native listeners, which enabled the accurate decoding of language proficiency.
  This result advances our understanding of the cortical processing of linguistic
  information in second-language learners and provides an objective measure of language
  proficiency.
