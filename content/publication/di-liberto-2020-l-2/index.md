abstract: Acquiring a new language requires a simultaneous and gradual learning of
  multiple levels of linguistic attributes. Here, we investigated how this process
  changes the neural encoding of natural speech by assessing the encoding of the linguistic
  feature hierarchy in second-language listeners. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals
  were recorded from native English and native Mandarin speakers with varied English
  proficiency as they listened to English stories. The neural encoding of acoustic,
  phonemic, phonotactic, and semantic features was measured in individual participants.
  We found a progressive convergence of linguistic feature representation in native
  and nonnative listeners with increased proficiency, which enabled accurate decoding
  of language proficiency. At the same time, we found distinct neural signatures in
  native and nonnative listeners that persisted even in the most proficient listeners.
  This detailed view advances our understanding of the cortical processing of linguistic
  information in second-language learners and provides an objective measure of language
  proficiency.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.
