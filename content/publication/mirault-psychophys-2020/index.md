abstract: 'When reading, can the next word in the sentence (word n + 1) influence
  how you read the word you are currently looking at (word n)? Serial models of sentence
  reading state that this generally should not be the case, whereas parallel models
  predict that this should be the case. Here we focus on perhaps the simplest and
  the strongest Parafoveal-on-Foveal (PoF) manipulation: word n + 1 is either the
  same as word n or a different word. Participants read sentences for comprehension
  and when their eyes left word n, the repeated or unrelated word at position n +
  1 was swapped for a word that provided a syntactically correct continuation of the
  sentence. We recorded electroencephalogram and eye-movements, and time-locked the
  analysis of fixation-related potentials (FRPs) to fixation of word n. We found robust
  PoF repetition effects on gaze durations on word n, and also on the initial landing
  position on word n. Most important is that we also observed significant effects
  in FRPs, reaching significance at 260 ms post-fixation of word n. Repetition of
  the target word n at position n + 1 caused a widely distributed reduced negativity
  in the FRPs. Given the timing of this effect, we argue that it is driven by orthographic
  processing of word n + 1, while readers were still looking at word n, plus the spatial
  integration of orthographic information extracted from these two words in parallel.'
