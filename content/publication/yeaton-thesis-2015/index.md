abstract: This paper experimentally investigates the roles of context and prosody
  in French in disambiguating simple transitive sentences with multiple negative expressions.
  Our results indicate that while Negative Concord (NC) is sometimes preferred in
  French, that this is not always the case, and that some speakers actually prefer
  Double Negative (DN) interpretations. Our results also show that context plays a
  significant role in disambiguating these sentences for most but not all speakers,
  as some speakers consistently choose the same interpretation regardless of context.
  An acoustic analysis of recordings produced by our participants also shows the use
  of prosody in the disambiguation of these sentences in the use of a higher pitch
  accent in the DN interpretation. The location of the pitch accent tended to fall
  on one (or both) of the negative items in the sentence, but was not uniform across
  all subjects.
