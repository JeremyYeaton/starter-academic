abstract: "The literature regarding the neural basis of syntax is a varied landscape of mutually incompatible descriptions of how and where hierarchical structure is generated and processed. In this work, I first lay out the predominant neurobiological models of syntax, followed by a tour of the evidence for and against brain regions argued to be implicated in the process. I close by discussing the compatibility of the theoretical models with the empirical data."
