abstract: Evidence that DN readings arise in solid NC languages more than previously
  thought (Déprez et al. 2015) underscore the importance of investigating the factors
  governing their emergence to deepen our understanding of Negative Concord. This
  paper examines the roles of context and prosody in disambiguating simple French
  transitive sentences with two NCIs (personne, rien) experimentally. French speakers
  were recorded reading target sentences with NCIs in NC or DN eliciting contexts
  followed by a verification statement judged as T/F and analyzed as context-matching
  or not. Context-matching targets were extracted using Praat and analyzed using ProsodyPro
  (Xu 2013). Sentence contour, average pitch and F0 peak value on NCIs were compared
  across conditions. Our results provide solid evidence that in French, context influence
  interpretation and NC and DN interpretations are prosodically distinguished.
