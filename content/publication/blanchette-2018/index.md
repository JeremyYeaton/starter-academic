abstract: Recent research demonstrates that prototypical negative concord (NC) languages
  allow double negation (DN) (Espinal & Prieto 2011; Prieto et al. 2013; Déprez et
  al. 2015; Espinal et al. 2016). In NC, two or more syntactic negations yield a single
  semantic one (e.g., the ‘I ate nothing’ reading of “I didn’t eat nothing”), and
  in DN each negation contributes to the semantics (e.g. ‘It is not the case that
  I ate nothing’). That NC and DN have been shown to coexist calls into question the
  hypothesis that grammars are either NC or DN (Zeijlstra 2004), and supports micro-parametric
  views of these phenomena (Déprez 2011; Blanchette 2017). Our study informs this
  debate with new experimental data from American English. We explore the role of
  syntax and speaker intent in shaping the perception and interpretation of English
  sentences with two negatives. Our results demonstrate that, like in prototypical
  NC languages (Espinal et al. 2016), English speakers reliably exploit syntactic,
  pragmatic, and acoustic cues to in selecting an NC or a DN interpretation.
