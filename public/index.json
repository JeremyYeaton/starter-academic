For example, if a man has robbed a bank and says I didn\u0026rsquo;t do nothing, we understand this as I didn\u0026rsquo;t do anything even though he used two negative words\u0026ndash;didn\u0026rsquo;t and nothing. By contrast, if a mother comes home from work and finds her child sitting in front of the television, she might accuse them of having done nothing all day, to which they might reply I didn\u0026rsquo;t do nothing. The child, however means exactly the opposite of what the bank robber meant \u0026ndash; that they did do something. French speakers have been shown to easily access both of these readings (Déprez et al. 2015), so we\u0026rsquo;ve undertaken a series of experiments to see how context (Déprez \u0026amp; Yeaton 2018), and prosody (Yeaton et al. forthcoming) might be employed to convey meaning.

Here, we investigated how this process changes the neural encoding of natural speech by assessing the encoding of the linguistic feature hierarchy in second-language listeners. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded from native English and native Mandarin speakers with varied English proficiency as they listened to English stories. The neural encoding of acoustic, phonemic, phonotactic, and semantic features was measured in individual participants. We found a progressive convergence of linguistic feature representation in native and nonnative listeners with increased proficiency, which enabled accurate decoding of language proficiency. At the same time, we found distinct neural signatures in native and nonnative listeners that persisted even in the most proficient listeners. This detailed view advances our understanding of the cortical processing of linguistic information in second-language learners and provides an objective measure of language proficiency.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.","tags":[],"title":"Neural representation of linguistic feature hierarchy reflects second-language proficiency","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonathan Mirault","Jeremy Yeaton","Fanny Broqua","Stéphane Dufau","Phillip J.

Serial models of sentence reading state that this generally should not be the case, whereas parallel models predict that this should be the case. Here we focus on perhaps the simplest and the strongest Parafoveal-on-Foveal (PoF) manipulation: word n + 1 is either the same as word n or a different word. Participants read sentences for comprehension and when their eyes left word n, the repeated or unrelated word at position n + 1 was swapped for a word that provided a syntactically correct continuation of the sentence. We recorded electroencephalogram and eye-movements, and time-locked the analysis of fixation-related potentials (FRPs) to fixation of word n. We found robust PoF repetition effects on gaze durations on word n, and also on the initial landing position on word n. Most important is that we also observed significant effects in FRPs, reaching significance at 260 ms post-fixation of word n. Repetition of the target word n at position n + 1 caused a widely distributed reduced negativity in the FRPs. Given the timing of this effect, we argue that it is driven by orthographic processing of word n + 1, while readers were still looking at word n, plus the spatial integration of orthographic information extracted from these two words in parallel.","tags":["\"eye-movements\"","\"fixation-related-potentials\"","\"parafoveal-on-foveal effects\"","\"parallel processing\"","\"reading\""],"title":"Parafoveal-on-foveal repetition effects in sentence reading: A co-registered eye-tracking and electroencephalogram study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeremy Yeaton","Arnaud Rey","Laure Tosatto"],"categories":[],"content":"In a series of experiments using a motor sequence learning task, we are examining the effect of different types of noise on the baboons' ability to extract a regularity (e.g.: AB) from a sequence.

The present study builds upon one conducted by Andersson et al. (2018) investigating behavioral and electrophysiological (EEG) responses to syntactic violations in a first or second language. The main goal of the previous study was to investigate whether the presence or absence of a syntactic feature (in this case V2 word order) would predict electrophysiological and/or behavioral responses to syntactic (word order) violations in the second language. The study found that while +/-V2 in the L1 did not seem to influence behavioral data, it did show some influence on the EEG results. The goal of the present study is twofold. We seek first to replicate the previous online and offline results found in a-V2 population, and then investigate the role of linguistic and cognitive variables in modulating the anticipated effect. We show that the same effect demonstrated by the-V2 participants in Andersson et al. (2018) is borne out in our French participants in the form of an anterior P600 effect. Furthermore, our data show a relationship between offline measures of cognitive functioning and online responses to linguistic stimuli. This work has implications for our understanding of cross-linguistic influence in L2 acquisition, as well as the role of domain general cognitive functions in processing language.","tags":[],"title":"Visual processing of verb-second (V2) word order in second language acquisition: ERP Evidence from French-Swedish successive bilinguals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Frances Blanchette","Marianna Nadeu","Jeremy Yeaton","Viviane Déprez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1519862400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607029513,"objectID":"75af01874bc0e990384232c9d0d49a9a","permalink":"https://jeremyyeaton.github.io/publication/blanchette-2018/","publishdate":"2020-12-03T21:19:50.836969Z","relpermalink":"/publication/blanchette-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Recent research demonstrates that prototypical negative concord (NC) languages allow double negation (DN) (Espinal \u0026 Prieto 2011; Prieto et al. 2013; Déprez et al. 2015; Espinal et al. 2016). In NC, two or more syntactic negations yield a single semantic one (e.g., the ‘I ate nothing’ reading of “I didn’t eat nothing”), and in DN each negation contributes to the semantics (e.g. ‘It is not the case that I ate nothing’). That NC and DN have been shown to coexist calls into question the hypothesis that grammars are either NC or DN (Zeijlstra 2004), and supports micro-parametric views of these phenomena (Déprez 2011; Blanchette 2017). Our study informs this debate with new experimental data from American English. We explore the role of syntax and speaker intent in shaping the perception and interpretation of English sentences with two negatives. Our results demonstrate that, like in prototypical NC languages (Espinal et al. 2016), English speakers reliably exploit syntactic, pragmatic, and acoustic cues to in selecting an NC or a DN interpretation.","tags":[],"title":"English negative concord and double negation: The division of labor between syntax and pragmatics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Viviane Déprez","Jeremy Yeaton"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607029513,"objectID":"4cc04bc932a831b72de219889b78346f","permalink":"https://jeremyyeaton.github.io/publication/deprez-yeaton-2018/","publishdate":"2020-12-03T21:19:50.541941Z","relpermalink":"/publication/deprez-yeaton-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Evidence that DN readings arise in solid NC languages more than previously thought (Déprez et al. 2015) underscore the importance of investigating the factors governing their emergence to deepen our understanding of Negative Concord.

Our results also show that context plays a significant role in disambiguating these sentences for most but not all speakers, as some speakers consistently choose the same interpretation regardless of context. An acoustic analysis of recordings produced by our participants also shows the use of prosody in the disambiguation of these sentences in the use of a higher pitch accent in the DN interpretation.
